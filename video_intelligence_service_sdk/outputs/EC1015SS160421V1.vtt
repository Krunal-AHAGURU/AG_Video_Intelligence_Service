00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.240
So, functional isomersum. So, what are functional isomersum compounds having say molecular

2
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.039
formula, but they differ in their functional group. Let us see few examples. The first one

3
00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:29.920
see the molecular formula C2 H6O. This can be either an alcohol, let us see H3, CH2O H or

4
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.200
it can be an ether. So, this is an alcohol because it has a OH group, this is R O R. So, which this

5
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.719
is an ether, coming, but look at this, they have the same molecular formula coming to the next

6
00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:55.280
example C3 H6O. So, this can be either an aldehyde. So, it can be either CH3, CH2, CHO. So,

7
00:00:55.359 --> 00:01:05.599
CHO group is the aldehyde or it could be also a ketone that is CH3, CW, CH3. And they have the

8
00:01:05.599 --> 00:01:16.000
same molecular formula coming to the next one, C3 H6O2. So, this could be an acid that is CH3, CH2,

9
00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:27.280
CW, H, or it could be an ester which is CH3, CW, O, CH3. So, this is the acid group, this is the

10
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:35.359
ester group, R, CW, R is the ester. Coming to the next example, C3 H4. So, this compound can

11
00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:41.200
either have a double bond in their structure or it could also have a triple bond. So, now,

12
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:50.000
let us see what are the two structures. It could be CH3, C triple bond, CH. So, this is just an

13
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:58.159
aldehyde because it has only triple bond or it could also be CH2 double bond. So, it can either

14
00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.200
process only triple bond or it could process two double bonds. So, that is this is an aldehyde,

15
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:13.199
this is an aldehyde. Next example, C3 H6N. So, this could be a cyanide that is CH3, CH2,

16
00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:22.080
CN or the point of attachment could be NC which is called the iso cyanide, CH3, CH2,

17
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.480
N triple bond C. So, this is called an iso cyanide, this is called a cyanide group. Now,

18
00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:40.959
coming to the next example, C2 H5ON. So, this could be either CH3, CHW bond, NOH, it is the

19
00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:52.399
auxine or it could be also CH3, CONH2. So, CO and H2 group is the amide group. So, we have seen

20
00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:57.439
all these examples with the same molecular formula, but see how the functional group differs.

21
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:05.840
Another concept of functional isomerism is double bond equivalent which is denoted as dB E.

22
00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:13.680
So, what is this dB E? This will give us an information about whether there is a double bond or

23
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:20.639
there is a ring in the structure. Now, this is a J E question, how many possible isomers are there

24
00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:27.520
in this of compound with molecular formula C3 H6O? See, if there is one O there could it could be an

25
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:34.960
aldehyde, it could be a ketone, it could be an alcohol and an ether. So, now, this with dB E will tell

26
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:41.200
us what kind of alcohol or ether it is. So, now, let us see the formula for dB, this is number of

27
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:48.960
carbon atoms minus number of hydrogen divided by 2 plus nitrogen divided by 2 plus 1. If there is no

28
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:55.040
nitrogen or any other like you know sulfur something, we can just omit this part. So, now, here

29
00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:03.760
in this case, if we calculate for C3 H6O, the number of carbon atoms is 3. So, 3 minus 6 hydrogen.

30
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:10.000
So, 6 by 2 as I told there is no nitrogen. So, we will just leave that and plus 1. So, this is

31
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:18.160
equivalent to 1 dB is 1. So, now, if dB is equal to 1, that means, there could be a double bond in

32
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:24.000
the compound or that could be a ring in the compound. So, this will give us an idea to write

33
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
the number of structural isomers possible here. So, now, what so, if there is a double bond as I told,

34
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.280
it could be an aldehyde, C HO. So, you can see the molecular formula is C3 H6O, A and it could be a

35
00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:43.680
ketone here. Now, the alcohol we cannot write the normal alcohol, because the molecular weight will

36
00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:49.280
not match with this. So, now, that means, there is a double bond here. So, I could write an

37
00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:55.280
alcohol here, where a double bond here in this position and OH attached to the C H2. So, this is

38
00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:02.399
one of the isomer. Now, I am just changing the double bond position here and OH, this is another isomer

39
00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:08.000
here, the OH could come to the second position and a double bond here, this is another isomer.

40
00:05:08.079 --> 00:05:14.079
Also, all these compounds that is 3, 4, 5, all these are alcohols. Now, the next one this could

41
00:05:14.079 --> 00:05:20.800
be an ether. So, R, O, R and as I told, it has a double bond. So, only if I put a double bond,

42
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:27.839
the molecular formula will match with the C3 H6O. So, this is an ether. Now, as I told, it could be a

43
00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:33.360
double bond or there could be also a ring in the compound. So, now, let us start writing.

44
00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:40.960
So, this is the simplest ring, when OH group here. So, this will also match with C3, H6O

45
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:48.160
or it could be an ether, a cyclic ether. So, or it could be another cyclic ether like this.

46
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:54.960
So, all these structures are possible, if you take one function to do so. So, that is an aldehyde

47
00:05:55.039 --> 00:06:02.799
is possible, ketone is possible and as alcohol with a double bond and an ether like a normal

48
00:06:02.799 --> 00:06:09.279
ether or with double bond is possible. So, totally how many structures are there? 9. So, the total

49
00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:17.439
possible isomer is 9. So, now, let us see another example with a double bond equivalent for the

50
00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:26.879
compound C4 H6. Let us proceed by calculating. So, DBE will be equal to number of carbon is 4 minus

51
00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:35.040
number of hydrogen is 6 by 2 plus there is no nitrogen, then plus 1. So, DBE will be equal to 2. So,

52
00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:42.000
what is this 2 indicate? So, when DBE is equal to 2, that means, there are two double bonds in the

53
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:49.279
compound or 1 triple bond or there can be two rings or there could be one double bond and one ring.

54
00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:53.519
So, when we apply all this, like we will see, we will get all these structures.

55
00:06:53.519 --> 00:06:59.040
First, let us see with respect to two double bond. So, the compound having two double bonds is

56
00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:06.879
one and two this two. There are two double bonds and we can see it is C4 H6 and C4 H6.

57
00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:12.800
Only the position of the double bond is varying here. Coming to the next one, one triple bond.

58
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:17.600
So, there is one triple bond here in the first position or there could be a triple bond in the

59
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:23.199
second position. So, these two are with respect to triple bond. Now, coming to two rings.

60
00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:28.800
So, there is only possibility is writing the structure like this, where this is considered as

61
00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:35.519
one ring and this is considered as one ring. Now, the next one is one double bond and one ring.

62
00:07:35.599 --> 00:07:42.000
So, it could be like this, that is cyclobutar dying with one double bond or it could be

63
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:50.159
a three membered ring with one alkyl group here. So, again there could be again three membered ring.

64
00:07:50.159 --> 00:07:54.719
Here, the methyl group is not attached to the double bond, here the methyl group is attached to

65
00:07:54.719 --> 00:08:00.319
the double bond. So, these are again one more possibility and the last one is the double bond is attached

66
00:08:00.399 --> 00:08:04.800
to the alkyl group here. So, again so, to be count the number of high somers,

67
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:13.040
there are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 are 9 isomers. So, totally there are 9 isomers possible for the compound

68
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:20.319
having molecular formula C4 H6. So, now let us see the next one in case the double bond equivalent

69
00:08:20.319 --> 00:08:27.600
is equal to 3. So, what are the possibilities? So, in case it is 3, there could be 3 double bond

70
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:36.399
in the compound or there could be a double bond plus 1 triple bond, 1 double bond plus 2 rings

71
00:08:36.399 --> 00:08:43.040
and 2 double bond plus 1 ring or the final could be there could be 3 rings which are attached to

72
00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:51.839
together.
