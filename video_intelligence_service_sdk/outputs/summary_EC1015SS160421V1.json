      "summary_text": "This lecture provides a detailed exploration of functional isomerism, a key concept in organic chemistry. We begin by defining functional isomers as compounds sharing the same molecular formula but differing in their functional groups. Through a series of examples, we illustrate how various functional groups, such as alcohols, ethers, aldehydes, ketones, acids, esters, cyanides, and isocyanides, can lead to different isomers with the same molecular formula. The session progresses to introduce the concept of Double Bond Equivalent (DBE) which helps in identifying the number of pi bonds or rings present in a molecule.\n\nThe lecture further explains how to calculate DBE using a straightforward formula, allowing us to predict the presence of double bonds, triple bonds, or rings within a compound's structure. We see how DBE calculations can significantly narrow down the possibilities and aid in identifying all possible isomers for a given molecular formula. Several examples are used to clarify the DBE formula and its application in determining the number of possible isomers for compounds with varying DBE values.\n\nDetailed examples are provided, illustrating how to draw different structural isomers based on the calculated DBE value. The session goes through scenarios where DBE equals 1, 2, and potentially 3, showcasing the variety of structural arrangements possible. These examples cover compounds with double bonds, triple bonds, rings, and combinations thereof, emphasizing how to systematically approach isomer identification. \n\nBy the end of this lecture, students will have a solid understanding of functional isomerism, the ability to calculate DBE, and the skills necessary to identify and draw various structural isomers for organic compounds. This knowledge is crucial for success in organic chemistry and related fields like JEE and NEET."
