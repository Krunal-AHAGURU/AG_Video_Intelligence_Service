00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.240
The next topic is isomerism. So, till now you study about isomerism, what are isomerism?

2
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.199
They compounds having the same molecular formula, but different structural formula. But to be

3
00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:32.320
more specific isomers are nothing but compounds having same molecular formula, but different

4
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:42.920
in their physical and chemical properties. So, different physical and chemical properties.

5
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:50.440
So, now under isomerism we will see two different topic that is structural isomerism

6
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:57.240
and stereo isomerism. So, here under structural isomerism if I want to define it is compounds

7
00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:13.960
having same molecular formula, but different structural formula, different structural formula.

8
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.599
So, under stereo isomerism we will have the same molecular formula. They will also have the

9
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:30.680
same structure, but only different in their difference in the physical and chemical properties.

10
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:40.040
So, that is why we have defined isomers as same molecular formula, but different physical

11
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:46.120
and chemical properties. So, now under structural isomerism we will be studying chain isomerism,

12
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:53.560
position, functional, total isomerism, ring chain and metomerism. Under stereo isomerism there

13
00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:00.359
are two topics that is configuration and conformational. Under configuration you will be studying

14
00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:12.759
geometrical and optical isomerism. Now under structural isomerism first we will see chain isomerism

15
00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:18.120
and position isomerism. I will take an example and tell you the difference between chain and position

16
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.120
isomerism. So, for coming to the definition part. So, chain isomerism is nothing, but

17
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.840
has compounds having same molecular formula, but it is different only in the number of carbon in

18
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:37.639
the main chain. Whereas position isomerism main chain will have the same number of carbon,

19
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:44.600
but only the substruents in the position of the substruents will vary in case of position isomerism.

20
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.200
So, now in 10 standard we have studied different isomers. So, we know that for methane,

21
00:02:51.800 --> 00:03:02.360
let us see H 4, then E 10, C H 3, C H 3, then for propane, we cannot write

22
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.160
E 10 isomerism. So, there are no isomers possible. Coming to the next compound beauty.

23
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:17.800
So, beauty. So, it is C H 3, C H 2, C H 3, so I see H 2, C H 3, so I see H 2, C H 3. So,

24
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:27.080
there are two isomers possible here. So, it is C H 3, C H 3, C H 3, C H 3, C H 3. So,

25
00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.760
1 is N beauty. And this one, so let me write the name, this is N beauty.

26
00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.400
And here as per IUPAC, this will be 2 metal propane.

27
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:56.280
And as per the common name, it will be Iso beauty. So, this one is your IUPAC and this is your

28
00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.800
common name. Coming to Pentane. So, we have studied, there are three isomers possible,

29
00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:11.479
2, 3, 4, 5. This is N Pentane. The other isomers are C H 3,

30
00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:25.879
5. So, this will be 2 metal beauty and as per IUPAC. And as per common name, this will be Iso

31
00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:38.040
Pentane. And what about new Pentane? It will be C H 3, C H 3, C H 3, C H 3. So, these are the isomers

32
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:47.240
of Pentane. That is 1, 2 and 3. Again, the common name is new Pentane. Whereas, the IUPAC

33
00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:54.839
name is 2, 2, die metal propane. So, we have seen for beauty, there are two isomers, Pentane,

34
00:04:54.920 --> 00:05:00.360
there are three isomers. Now, we will see for H G Z. So, let me just first write the structure and show

35
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:13.000
you. So, for H G Z, you just C H 2, 4, 5, 6. So, this will be considered as one isomer. The next

36
00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:23.720
let me start doing the branching, C H 3, C H 2, C H 3. So, this is one isomer.

37
00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:40.360
The other isomer will be C H 2, C H, C H 3, then we can also write C H 3.

38
00:05:43.959 --> 00:06:01.319
So, this is one isomer possible, then we have C H. So, these are the five isomers possible

39
00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:10.600
for H G Z. So, now this would be called N H G Z. Now, this would be called, like you know,

40
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.280
please remember, if these substituent that isomethyl group only if it is in the second position,

41
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:25.640
we will name it as Iso. So, the common name will be Iso H G Z. And the IUPAC name would be

42
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:39.160
2 metal Pentane, 2 metal Pentane. Here we have the IUPAC name, because in the third position

43
00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:47.400
this is a methyl group. So, this has only the IUPAC name, which is called 3 methyl Pentane.

44
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:55.720
So, now coming to the next one, in the second and third position there are methyl substituents.

45
00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:06.920
So, this would be called 2 3 die methyl, butane and this would be 2 2 die methyl

46
00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:16.360
butane or the common name would be, because in the second position there is a substituent.

47
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:25.000
So, this can be also called Neo H G Z. So, these are the different isomers for H G Z.

48
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:31.879
Now, coming to the difference between chain and position isomers. So, as per chain isomersum,

49
00:07:31.879 --> 00:07:37.560
the number of carbon should be different in the main chain. So, now I consider let me number this

50
00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:49.959
has 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. So, if I consider 1 and 2 they are chain isomers, because here we have like

51
00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:57.480
you know number of carbon here is 6, here it is 5 in the long chain. So, these 2 are chain isomersum,

52
00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:04.040
but when I consider these 2 that is 2 and 3, look at the number of carbon in the main chain. So,

53
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:10.040
here also it is 5, here also it is 5, only the substituent position is varying. So, this would be

54
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:16.440
position isomersum. Coming to this one and this one that is 1 and 4, again there will be a chain

55
00:08:16.439 --> 00:08:22.759
isomersum, because number of carbon here is 6, here it is 4 in the main chain. Coming to this one,

56
00:08:22.759 --> 00:08:28.519
that is 4 and 5, you can see the number of carbon in the longest chain is the same.

57
00:08:28.519 --> 00:08:33.240
Only the substituent side taking different position. So, these 2 would be considered as

58
00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:40.759
position isomersum. So, now for the alchains we have seen butane has 2 isomers, pentane 3 and

59
00:08:40.759 --> 00:08:48.360
hexane 5 isomers. And you can also try heptane octane nonin and decay. Heptane has 9 octane has

60
00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:55.399
18 nonin has 35 and decayness 75. You can try it out by drawing different isomers. Coming to the

61
00:08:55.399 --> 00:09:02.840
next one isomersum of alchial groups. So, when we call an alchial group imagine we take a methane.

62
00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:08.200
So, if we remove a hydrogen and substitute with a halogen or any substitutes we call that as a

63
00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:14.840
methyl group. So, CH3 will be methyl group. Suppose I substitute with iodine let us say. So, here

64
00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:20.680
there is no other isomer possible. Coming to ethyl group also if I put a substituent here,

65
00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:26.120
either it is attached this side or that side it is the same thing. So, no isomers possible here.

66
00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:31.240
Coming to propile group when it came to propane we found there were no isomers. But whereas,

67
00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:37.480
in propile group we can see there are 2 isomers. One is suppose I substitute iodine here.

68
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:43.000
So, either this carbon or this carbon it is the first carbon. So, this will be one of the isomers

69
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.800
first isomers. That is it will be one isodopropane. Coming to the second isomers this isodine can be

70
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:54.840
substituted in the second position. So, I will write the second isomers like this.

71
00:09:57.399 --> 00:10:03.720
So, in case of propile group there are 2 isomers possible. Coming to the next one,

72
00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:11.080
biotile group c 4 h 9 and I am substituting with the chlorine. So, this is n butane. Now,

73
00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:18.440
let me explain step by step. First we will write the 2 isomers possible for butane. So, these

74
00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:26.759
are the 2 isomers n butane and 2 metal propane. Now, let us see like in a how we can differentiate

75
00:10:26.759 --> 00:10:33.240
these 2. We can see these 2 c h 3 groups are identical same. So, let us number

76
00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:40.440
it as 1. Now, these 2 carbons in the middle one they both are same because this is attached to

77
00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:45.799
one metal group this is attached to one ethyl group. Similarly, this c h 2 group this is attached

78
00:10:45.799 --> 00:10:52.039
to one ethyl group and this is metal. So, I will number these carbons as 2. Now, if I substitute

79
00:10:52.039 --> 00:11:00.279
with chlorine. So, either I can substitute here that is c h 2 c l or I can substitute another one

80
00:11:00.279 --> 00:11:09.639
that is c h 3 c h 2 here it will be c h chlorine and it will be c h 3 here. So, these are the

81
00:11:09.639 --> 00:11:17.959
2 possible isomers when it is n butane. So, let us take these as 2 isomers. Coming to the next isomer

82
00:11:17.959 --> 00:11:23.720
of butane we write it like this. Now, let us substitute with the halogen which is chlorine. So,

83
00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:29.799
you can see that this c h 3 all of this c h 3 are identical all 3 are connected with one c

84
00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:36.360
h. So, I will number all these carbons as 1 and the next carbon which is different is the

85
00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:42.120
middle one. So, I will number this as 2. So, now the chlorine can either take one of these positions

86
00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:48.440
it will be the same and it can take the second position. So, there are 2 possible isomers here also.

87
00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:56.120
So, 2 plus 2 4. So, for butane chlorine like this there are 4 isomers possible.
