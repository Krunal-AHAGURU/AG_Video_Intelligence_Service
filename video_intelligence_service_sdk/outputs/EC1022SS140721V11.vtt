00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.560
Now, we have given this component C4, H10O which is a molecular formula and they have mentioned

2
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:20.600
that this is an alcohol and how many isomer are possible for the alcohol, so now let

3
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:27.240
let us start writing these structures, first let us take the longest chain C4, so it could

4
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:42.299
be CH2O which, so C4 H10O this is one alcohol, so this is 4, so it is butane butane

5
00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:50.160
one on, now let us change this OH to the next position, so we can write the other structure

6
00:00:50.160 --> 00:01:07.359
like this CH3, CH2, CHO, CH3, so this will be butane to all, now we will see whether

7
00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:12.719
we can write some more structures, so we will branch this longest chain again, so we will

8
00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:30.079
see, CH3, COH, let me branch it here, CH3, so it will be CH, CH2OH, so now there is a metal

9
00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:35.280
substituent here, so this will become, so this will be our longest chain now, so this will

10
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:59.159
be 1, 2, so 2 metal, propane one on, so there can be another branching also CH3, so this

11
00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:05.599
is another one possible, so this will be our longest chain now, in the second position there

12
00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:18.240
is a metal group and OH group now, so we can write this as 2 metal propane 2 all, so

13
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.520
totally there are 4 isomers for this alcohol,
