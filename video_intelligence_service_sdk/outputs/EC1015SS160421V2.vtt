00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.120
So, now, what is metamirism, they are composed having the same molecular formula and the

2
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:20.559
same functional group also, but they differ only in the size of the alkyl groups on both

3
00:00:20.559 --> 00:00:27.519
size of a polyvalent atom or group. Suppose, I take this example C 4 H 10 O, the polyvalent

4
00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:33.200
atom here is oxygen. So, now, first let us start one by one, first let us calculate

5
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:40.000
the dB here. So, dBE, if we calculate this will be equal to 0 and this will have the

6
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:49.519
general formula C and H 2 and plus 2. So, when dB equal to 0, please remember that it cannot

7
00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:55.359
be aldehyde and ketone because we are ruling out the double bond category here. So, now, this

8
00:00:55.359 --> 00:01:01.840
could be if one oxygen is it, it could be only an alcohol or a ether. So, now, I have just written

9
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.280
some of the functional groups like you know the isomers here. So, one is with alcohol,

10
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.719
other one with ether. Now, I have written this one alcohol here, which is in the first position

11
00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:18.480
OH group is there, here in the second position OH group is there, here it is taking a tertiary position

12
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.960
the alcohol group. Now, when I see here, we cannot say that these compounds are metamers because

13
00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.439
as I told the alcohol groups we it has to differ with the alcohol groups on both sides of the

14
00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:38.000
polyvalent group. So, now here on one side there is alcohol group and other side only hydrogen.

15
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.239
So, this is not an alcohol group. Similarly, here one side all these are alcohol groups and hydrogen

16
00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:50.879
similarly here also. So, these will not come under metamers. Now, only the thing is with ethers.

17
00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:56.879
So, now, we see here this ethers, see here this side there are two carbons and this side there are

18
00:01:56.879 --> 00:02:03.359
two carbons. Similarly, I have written another structure where there are the three carbons here

19
00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:10.479
and one carbon here. So, when we consider 4 and 5, they are called metamers.

20
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:22.959
Okay. Similarly, if I take 5 and 6, they are not metamers because here also 3 carbons,

21
00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:30.479
here also 3 carbons. So, here this would be chain isomers. Chain isomers.

22
00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:39.039
Consider, now 4 and 6, here there are two, here there are two, here there are three,

23
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.799
here there is one. So, now even 4 and 6 are metamers.

24
00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:53.039
Now, coming to another one with alcohols, here the OH position is in the first carbon,

25
00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:59.840
here in the second carbon. So, if we consider these two, so one and two will show position isomers.

26
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:09.840
So, now coming to 2 and 3, okay. So, here also in the second position OH which is

27
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.680
there, here also second position, but the chain length is differing. So, these two will come

28
00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:29.199
under 2 and 3 will come under chain isomers. So, similarly, if I say 1 and 4, then

29
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:35.280
they differ in their functional groups. So, 1 and 4 are functional isomers.

30
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.040
Okay. So, now when it comes to position here, now I want to explain one more thing here,

31
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.880
when we consider 4 and 5, there is difference in the position of the functional group.

32
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:57.040
Okay. So, when it comes to both position and metamers, metamers will take the priority,

33
00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.039
compared to the position isomers. So, the next isomers is stortomers isom. So, what is

34
00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:09.359
stortomers isom? It is defined as when two different structures having the same molecular formula

35
00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:16.959
will undergo a rearrangement due to hydrogen. So, that is also called the 1, 3 hydrogen shift.

36
00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:24.319
So, let us explain this with some examples. Now, here I have taken a ketone, okay. So, this can

37
00:04:24.399 --> 00:04:30.639
undergo a rearrangement. So, let me number this as 1, 2 and 3. As I said here, it

38
00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:36.800
will undergo 1, 3, hydrogen shift. So, from the first position, it will go to the third position.

39
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:43.680
As a result, this double bond will shift here. So, we can write this as CH2, double bond,

40
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:53.920
CH3. Now, this is a ketone and this is having a double bond and OH. So, this is called

41
00:04:53.920 --> 00:05:02.160
E0. So, this is the ketone form and this is the E0 form, okay. So, such isomers are called tautomers,

42
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:08.879
okay. So, now here, if I take another example here, let us see this. Here, there is a nitrogrope here.

43
00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:14.720
Now, let us see how it undergoes a rearrangement. Let me number this as 1, 2 and 3. Again,

44
00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:20.000
there will be a 1, 3 hydrogen shift, okay. Now, here this hydrogen in the third position. So,

45
00:05:20.079 --> 00:05:24.720
this one will go to the first position as the result, the double bond will shift here.

46
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:36.959
So, the compound would be CH3, CH double bond and OH and OH minus, okay. So, now, if you see,

47
00:05:36.959 --> 00:05:43.920
this is a nitrogrope, whereas this is the hydroxyl nitrogrope. Now, these two are also again called

48
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:50.560
tautomeric structures. Now, here, let us take an amine here. So, if I, if there is an NH2 group,

49
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:56.800
it is called an amine group. Now, again, if I consider this as 1, 2 and 3, okay. There will be

50
00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:03.360
hydrogen shift. Now, I can take this hydrogen and shift it to the third position. So, this can be

51
00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:12.240
CH3, single bond, CH double bond, NH. So, this is a amine group and this is called

52
00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:19.280
let me write it down. This is an amine group and this is called an amine. When there is a double bond

53
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:25.680
attached to NH, it is called amine group. Now, let us see some more examples. Here, I have taken some

54
00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:31.120
aromatic compounds. Here, there is an aldehyde and here, I have taken a ketone. Now, here,

55
00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:38.079
it is, there is no tautomerism possible, so, tautomerism possible, because here, this hydrogen,

56
00:06:38.079 --> 00:06:43.919
this hydrogen cannot shift. Whereas, if I consider this carbon here, there is no hydrogen there.

57
00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:49.039
So, there is no hydrogen here and in this side only hydrogen is there, it does not attach to any

58
00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:55.599
carbon. So, this compound will not undergo tautomerism. Whereas, the same thing, I have substituted

59
00:06:55.599 --> 00:07:01.039
hydrogen with a methyl group here. As we see in this carbon, there is no hydrogen, but whereas,

60
00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:06.879
in this carbon, there is hydrogen. So, if I number this as 1, 2 and 3, this hydrogen can

61
00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:21.360
undergo a shift. So, this could be written like this. So, C double bond, C H to again here,

62
00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:27.439
we can see ketofone and anineol form. So, these are some examples of tautomerism.
