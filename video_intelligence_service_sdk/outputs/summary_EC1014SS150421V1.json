      "summary_title": "Understanding Isomerism: Structural and Stereo Isomers",
      "summary_text": "This lecture provides a comprehensive overview of isomerism in organic compounds, a crucial concept for understanding the diversity of chemical structures and their properties. The session begins by defining isomerism as compounds with the same molecular formula but differing physical and chemical properties. A key distinction is made between structural and stereo isomers, setting the stage for a deeper exploration of each type.\n\nThe lecture then delves into structural isomerism, focusing on chain and position isomers. Clear examples are provided to illustrate how differences in the carbon chain length or the position of substituents lead to distinct isomers. The discussion extends to alkanes such as butane, pentane, and hexane, demonstrating how to identify and name their various isomeric forms using both IUPAC and common nomenclature.\n\nFinally, the lecture examines isomerism in alkyl groups, emphasizing how substituting a hydrogen atom with a halogen or other substituent can create different isomers. Propyl and butyl groups are used as examples, highlighting the importance of identifying identical carbon atoms within a molecule to determine the number of possible isomers. The session concludes by differentiating between chain and position isomers through detailed examples, solidifying the core concepts of isomerism."
