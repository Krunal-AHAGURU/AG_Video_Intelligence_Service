      "summary_text": "This session explores the concept of structural isomers, specifically focusing on alcohols with the molecular formula C4H10O. The lecture guides you through the process of identifying and drawing different isomers by varying the position of the hydroxyl (-OH) group and branching the carbon chain. Each unique arrangement represents a distinct isomer with different physical and chemical properties. You'll learn how to systematically approach isomer identification, ensuring that all possible structures are considered. \n\nThe discussion begins with the simplest straight-chain isomer, butan-1-ol, and progresses to more complex branched structures. Nomenclature is key, as the naming conventions help differentiate between isomers and accurately reflect their structure. Understanding how to correctly name these isomers is crucial. \n\nBy carefully manipulating the carbon skeleton and the position of the functional group, we derive four distinct isomers of C4H10O. These examples demonstrate how even with the same molecular formula, different arrangements of atoms can lead to unique compounds.\nIn conclusion, the four isomers identified are butan-1-ol, butan-2-ol, 2-methylpropan-1-ol, and 2-methylpropan-2-ol. This session emphasizes the importance of structural variations and their impact on chemical identity. "

    "starting_build_up": "The session begins by introducing the concept of isomers, particularly focusing on structural isomers of alcohols. The specific task is to determine the number of possible alcohol isomers for the molecular formula C4H10O. We establish the context for understanding how different arrangements of atoms within a molecule can result in distinct compounds with varying properties. The lecture sets the stage for a step-by-step exploration of isomer identification, emphasizing systematic approaches to ensure comprehensive coverage.",
    "end_summary": "In summary, we've systematically identified and drawn all possible alcohol isomers for the molecular formula C4H10O. This exercise demonstrates the importance of considering both the position of the hydroxyl group and branching within the carbon chain to accurately represent all structural variations. The four identified isomers are butan-1-ol, butan-2-ol, 2-methylpropan-1-ol, and 2-methylpropan-2-ol. The skill of isomer identification is crucial for organic chemistry.",

First, the -OH group is placed on the first carbon, creating butan-1-ol. Then, the -OH group is moved to the second carbon, resulting in butan-2-ol. These two isomers represent the possibilities when the carbon chain remains linear. The session stresses the importance of correctly naming each isomer according to IUPAC nomenclature.",
