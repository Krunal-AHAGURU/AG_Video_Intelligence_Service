      "summary_title": "Understanding Functional Isomerism and Double Bond Equivalents",
      "summary_text": "This lecture explores the concept of functional isomerism, where compounds share the same molecular formula but differ in their functional groups. Several examples are presented, including alcohols and ethers, aldehydes and ketones, acids and esters, and compounds with double or triple bonds. The session emphasizes how different arrangements of atoms within a molecule can lead to distinct chemical properties and reactivity. \n\nThe lecture introduces the Double Bond Equivalent (DBE) as a tool to determine the number of rings or pi bonds within a molecule. The formula for calculating DBE is explained, and its application in predicting the possible structural isomers for compounds with specific molecular formulas is demonstrated through multiple examples. These examples focus on identifying isomers with varying degrees of unsaturation, including double bonds, triple bonds, and rings.\n\nSeveral examples are discussed with DBE values of 1, 2, and 3. These examples illustrate how to systematically deduce the possible structures based on the DBE value and the types of functional groups present. By understanding the DBE concept, students can effectively predict and draw the structures of various isomers for a given molecular formula, which is a crucial skill in organic chemistry.\n\nThis session provides a solid foundation for students to understand and apply the principles of functional isomerism and DBE calculations in predicting and identifying organic compounds."

    "starting_build_up": "The session starts by defining functional isomerism and motivating its importance in understanding the diversity of organic compounds. Students will learn to identify compounds with the same molecular formula but different functional groups. Furthermore, the lecture introduces double bond equivalents (DBE) as a tool for predicting the number of rings or pi bonds in a molecule, aiding in the determination of possible isomers.",
    "end_summary": "In conclusion, the lecture provided a comprehensive overview of functional isomerism and the application of double bond equivalents (DBE) in determining possible isomers. The session covered various examples with DBE values ranging from 1 to 3, showcasing how different combinations of double bonds, triple bonds, and rings can result in multiple isomeric structures for a single molecular formula. Understanding these concepts will significantly improve students' abilities to predict and draw organic structures.",
