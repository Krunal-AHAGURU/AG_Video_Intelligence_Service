      "summary_title": "Understanding Functional Isomerism and Double Bond Equivalent (DBE)",
      "summary_text": "This lecture explores the concept of functional isomerism, a phenomenon where different compounds share the same molecular formula but possess distinct functional groups. Several illustrative examples are provided, demonstrating how a single molecular formula can represent alcohols, ethers, aldehydes, ketones, acids, esters, cyanides, isocyanides, auxines, and amides. The lecture emphasizes the importance of identifying the functional group to distinguish between isomers.\n\nThe session introduces the Double Bond Equivalent (DBE) as a valuable tool for predicting the presence of double bonds, triple bonds, or rings within a molecule. The formula for calculating DBE is explained in detail, along with how the resulting value helps determine the possible structural arrangements of atoms in a compound. The DBE calculation helps to quickly identify possible structures that adhere to the molecular formula.\n\nSeveral examples are worked through step-by-step, demonstrating how to calculate DBE and then use this information to deduce the possible isomers of a given molecular formula. These examples include compounds with DBE values of 1, 2, and 3, highlighting how increasing DBE values correspond to greater structural complexity and a wider range of possible isomers. Specific attention is paid to identifying isomers with double bonds, triple bonds, and cyclic structures.\n\nBy the end of the session, students will grasp the definition of functional isomerism, be able to calculate and interpret DBE values, and apply this knowledge to predict the possible structural isomers of organic compounds."

        "question": "Compound Y has the molecular formula C5H10 and is found to be an alkene. When treated with HBr, it forms a single monobrominated product. Propose a structure for Compound Y.",
        "answer": "The fact that only *one* monobrominated product forms implies Compound Y is symmetrical. Since it's an alkene with formula C5H10 and thus DBE of 1, it must be an alkene and also symmetrical. Therefore, the most likely structure is 2-methylbut-2-ene or 2,3-dimethylbut-2-ene."

        "question": "Two organic compounds A and B have the same molecular formula C3H6O. Compound A reduces Fehling's solution, whereas compound B does not. Identify compounds A and B and provide their structures.",
        "answer": "Compound A is an aldehyde (propanal: CH3CH2CHO) because it reduces Fehling's solution. Compound B is a ketone (propanone/acetone: CH3COCH3) because ketones do not reduce Fehling's solution. Both have the same molecular formula."

        "question": "An organic compound C has the molecular formula C4H8O2. It has a fruity smell and is commonly used as a solvent. What functional group is likely present in compound C? Give a possible structure.",
        "answer": "The fruity smell suggests it's an ester. Formula C4H8O2 confirms this. One possible structure is ethyl ethanoate (CH3COOCH2CH3)."
