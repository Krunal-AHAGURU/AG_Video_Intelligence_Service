      "summary_title": "Isomerism in Alcohols: Determining Isomers of C4H10O",
      "summary_text": "This lecture focuses on the concept of isomerism in organic chemistry, specifically concerning alcohols. It addresses the question of determining the number of possible isomers for an alcohol with the molecular formula C4H10O. The session systematically explores different structural arrangements to identify all possible isomers, including variations in the position of the hydroxyl group (-OH) and branching patterns within the carbon chain.\n\nThe lecture walks through the process of constructing various isomers, starting with the longest straight-chain structure and progressively introducing branching and positional changes of the functional group. Each isomer is named according to IUPAC nomenclature to clearly identify its structure. Key aspects covered include identifying the parent chain, numbering the carbons, and naming substituents.\n\nBy the end of this lecture, students will understand how to systematically identify and draw all possible isomers for a given alcohol, as well as how to apply IUPAC nomenclature rules to name them correctly. This understanding is crucial for grasping the relationship between molecular structure and properties in organic compounds, a vital concept for JEE and NEET preparation.\n\nThe session provides a step-by-step approach, demonstrating how to methodically derive each possible isomer and ensure that no duplicates or invalid structures are included. This process reinforces the core principles of structural isomerism and nomenclature in organic chemistry."
